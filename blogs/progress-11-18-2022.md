# The first fully functional Prototype
Most of the fundamental properties are now the app's properties instead of being Userdata's properties.

![The Properties](/images/week4/Properties.png)

Created new app's properties \
**app.code** to store the codes saved by the user and pre-defined codes. \
**app.topic_Dict** stores the MQTT topics for each defined tasks. \
**app.task_Dict** stores the MQTT payloads for each defined tasks. \
**app.code_listbox** to store the "code = task" strings for displaying in the Task list. \
**app.code_dict** to store the code-task relations.

Implimented the functions developed [last week](https://github.com/JedsadaSrijunpoe/IR_remote_MQTT_MATLAB/blob/main/index.md#third-week) to the main project.

Added a condition that stops the task saving (or assigning) function from working when there is no code stored to prevent error.

Added a condition that stops the task deleting function from working when there is task selected in the task list to prevent error.

Added the buttons that allow users to control the zigbee end devices directly from the GUI app.
